### Project Technical Deliverables

This Mobile App is used for collecting in-situ ground-based data. The application should be able to _provide GPS point mapping and data recording capabilities (Add marks and save Points) within the mobile application)_.
The Basemaps are powered by [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps)

- The mobile application platform will be used by the data collection officers to record findings collected while in a data collection exercise. The mobile application should have, but is not limited to, the following capabilities;<br>

- [ ] Ability to log in users accounts created from the admin web platform. 
- [ ] Ability for logged in users to view their associated data collection projects. 
- [ ] The mobile app should generate screen elements for the data collection form, with respect to question types with the following specifications: <br>
    - Text input for open ended questions 
    - Radio buttons for single selection multiple choice questions 
    - Check-boxes for multiple selection multiple choice question 
    - Custom button for GPS input and image/camera input.<br>
- [ ] Ability to temporarily store draft responses in the mobile local storage. 
- [ ] Ability to edit draft responses stored in the mobile local storage. 
- [ ] Ability to forward finalized responses to the back-end database. 
- [ ] Display GPS points on Android and iOS base maps
